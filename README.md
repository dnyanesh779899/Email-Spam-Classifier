ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection
Python, Scikit-Learn & NLP
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam) based on their text content. By applying TF-IDF vectorization and a Logistic Regression model, the system learns patterns in email messages and can predict the category for new incoming emails.

ðŸ“· Features
Reads and processes an email dataset (mail_data.csv).

Cleans and prepares the text data for machine learning.

Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features.

Trains a Logistic Regression classifier to identify spam emails.

Achieves over 96% accuracy on test data.

Allows user to input custom email text for real-time spam prediction.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Data Loading â€“ Import the dataset containing labeled emails (spam/ham).

Preprocessing â€“ Replace null values, convert labels (spam â†’ 0, ham â†’ 1).

Feature Extraction â€“ Apply TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform text into feature vectors.

Model Training â€“ Train a Logistic Regression model on the processed data.

Evaluation â€“ Measure model accuracy on training and test sets.

Prediction â€“ Input a custom email message and predict whether itâ€™s spam or not.
